    <h3>What is an annuity due?</h3>
    <p>An annuity due is an annuity whose payment is due immediately at the beginning of each period. A common example of an annuity due payment is rent, as landlords often require payment upon the start of a new month as opposed to collecting it after the renter has enjoyed the benefits of the apartment for an entire month.

    <h4>There are hundreds of sites explaining annuities, maybe this calculator might help too.</h4>
